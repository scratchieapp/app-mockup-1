- **Enhanced search functionality** with tags and synonyms for quick discovery
- **Environment-aware content** (Office vs Field differentiation)

### Role-Specific Guidance
- **Tailored ConvoCard use cases** for office vs field environments:
  - **Office environments**: Achievement recognition, project milestones, team celebrations
  - **Field environments**: Safety compliance, skill demonstrations, hazard reporting
- **Tips screens** customized for both workers and managers
- **Pro benefits screen** highlighting manager upgrade opportunities
- Context-aware content based on selected user role and industry

### Technical Features
- **State persistence** using localStorage for seamless experience
- **Analytics tracking system** for comprehensive user behavior insights
- **Debug panel** (accessible via `?debug=true`) for development testing
- **Reset demo button** for easy flow restart during testing
- **Error boundaries** for graceful failure handling
- **Responsive design** optimized for mobile devices
